                        I joined Vyce Games in November 2023 as the Marketing Team Lead and was promoted to Operations Manager by May 2024. During my time with the company, I played a key role in the design and development of our upcoming game mode, CIVS, which was planned for release through a featured partnership with Mineplex in December 2024. Although Vyce Games ultimately shut down, my time there allowed me to gain valuable experience across marketing, operations, and game development.

                    <p>
                        In addition to my work on CIVS, I also served as the main designer and editor of our website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241114082835/https://vycegames.com/" target="_blank">Vyce Games</a>. I wrote all of our blog posts and maintained the site's design to ensure it reflected our company's aesthetic and branding.
