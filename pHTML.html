	<!-- As this page is to focus on expanding upon the chosen project I needed to find a way to differentiate it easier than just creating a div, I googled main content in html and learned about "main" section you can use, I utilised this specifically for the individual project sections to help make them stand out, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main -->

                <p class="bProj-description">
                    I wanted a space that felt like me, but also somewhere I could show my work in a clean and professional way. For this reason I 
                    felt it was important for this website to be part portfolio, part playground.
				</p>
                <div class="bProj-image">
                    <img src="photos/logo.png" alt="Vyce Games Image">

                <div class="html-section">
                    <p>Beginning my process in <strong>Figma</strong> I sketched out the initial wireframes and sitemape. This helped me to visualise
                    the structure of the site, plan the appropriate navigation and decided how I wanted to balance content with negative space.
                I chose a <strong>minimalist style</strong> with a limited colour paleter, using pink as an accent in order to add warmth and individuality
            without overwhelming the overall aesthetic.
        <br>
    <br>
    I then built the website with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> (and a little <strong>JavaScript</strong>). I experimented with different hover effects and transitions
which not only add interactivity but also helped to create a sense of polish. I used Flexbox and CSS Grids to structure content and ensure the site is responsive across
devices.
<br>
<br>
While I wanted the site to feel professional, I also wanted it to feel like <strong>me</strong>. I included small details throughout the site in order to acheive this.
This included the soft pink mentioned above, but also a hidden CV for Troy within my about page. I felt as though these touches were important to make the site feel both
welcoming and memorable, while still presenting my work in a professional way.
<br>
<br>
This site gave me hands-on experience with <strong>design-to-code workflow,</strong> from creating wireframes to building a live site. It also taught me the value of planning ahead
testing responsiveness and finding the correct palance between professionalism and personality.
