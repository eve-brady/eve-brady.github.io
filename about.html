    <h1>Me</h1>
    <p> One Christmas, my brother unwrapped a brand-new PlayStation 3. I unwrapped a pink Game Boy Micro with <strong> Disney Princess</strong> and <strong>Bratz</strong>, 
        and I was absolutely convinced that mine was better. Looking back, I think that sums me up. I've always valued the fun, personailty and the unexpected over what's 
        considered "proper". <br>
<br> As a kid, I spent hours on <strong>The Simpsons Hit & Run, Animal Cross:New Leaf, Club Penguin, Minecraft</strong> and even <strong>The sims</strong>. At 18, I bought myself a second-hand PlayStation 
3 to dip my toe into the wider gaming world, starting with <Strong>Grand Theft Auto V</Strong>. I loved the open worlds and details, so much so that when I visited LA some 
years later, I felt I felt like I already knew my way around. <br>
<br> It was during the pandeic, though, that I truly fell in love with the narrative side of games. Titles like <strong>Red Dead Redepmtion 2, Baldur's Gate 3</strong> and 
even <strong>Valorant</strong> showed me how storytelling, worldbuilding and player agency could come together in ways no other medium could match. That's when I knew I didn't 
Just want to play games but I wanted to help create them.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>My journey into the video game industry began through my hobbies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I started collaborating with Zach Spangler, better known as YouTube's 
        LoverFella. Working with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6XC9hvuZtlxfDYvI1WAEg" target="_blank">his YouTube channel</a> and 
        <a href="https://store.loverfella.com/" target="_blank">Minecraft server</a> ignited my passion for game development and design. This initial experience led me to 
        join Vyce Games, a video game start-up, where I further honed my skills and deepened my interest in the industry.<br>

	<br>At <a href="https://vycegames.com" target="_blank">Vyce Games</a>, I became more involved in the entire creative process, creating, designing, and developing 
    video games. These experiences inspired me to expand my technical knowledge, which led me to enroll in Trinity College's Master program in Interactive Digital Media. <br>

    <br>During my Master’s at Trinity College, I developed and refined a broad range of technical skills, including <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX design, as well as 
        sound and video production</strong>. I applied these skills across multiple projects, from practical apps like a travel planner to an accessibility-focused app for 
        Dublin’s DART rail system. By far my favourite project was <a href="rThesis.html" target="_blank">The Little Picture</a>, a narrative-driven game I co-conceptualised and built 
        with four classmates in just two months. I led the <strong>narrative direction</strong>, acted as <strong>project manager</strong>, and contributed to <strong>audio sourcing
             and editing</strong>, and the game is now available as a demo on  <a href="https://axelftv.itch.io/the-little-picture" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.

            <p>This is Troy, my 11 year old puggle. He loves to cuddle (on his terms), squeaky toys and stealing our socks!<br> 
                <br>His favourite food is literally anything and his favourite toy is a fox.</p>
